# `Inspiration`

[Spotify Wrapped](https://www.spotify.com/is/wrapped/)
Using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) I wanted to develop a dashboard with more comprehensive statistics for users that can show their relationship with music.

This also served as the basis for my learning of front-end.
